<b>Arachidonic acid metabolism</b><br>
The uploaded MATLAB code simulates arachidonic acid metabolism in bone marrow derived macrophages under consideration of initial and time-dependent enzyme expression levels, as predicted from proteomics and transcriptomic datasets.<br>
<br>
The graphml-file can be opened with yED editor (yworks.com/products/yed) and shows the modeled reactions and their subcellular localizations. The reaction numbers in the yED network correspond to the reaction numbers in the MATLAB code. Network layout is 'organic'.Reactions within the same subcellular compartment are boxed and can be copy pasted into a new file to remove the membrane association/dissociation arrows. Selection of Windows/context views/neighborhood allows visualization of single reactions.<br>
<br>
MATLAB code and graphml file were automatically written by an unpublished C# script that integrates canonical dynamical models with transcriptomic and/or proteomic steady state and/or timeline data to generate cell type selective models.<br>
