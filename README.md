<b>Arachidonic acid metabolism</b><br>
The uploaded MATLAB code simulates arachidonic acid metabolism in bone marrow derived macrophages under consideration of initial and time-dependent enzyme expression levels, as predicted from proteomics and transcriptomic datasets.<br>
<br>
The graphml-file can be opened with yED editor (yworks.com/products/yed) and shows the modeled reactions and their subcellular localizations. The reaction numbers in the yED network correspond to the reaction numbers in the MATLAB code. Selection of Windows/context views/neighborhood allows visualization of single reactions.<br>
<br>
MATLAB code and graphml file were automatically written by an unpublished C# script that integrates canonical dynamical models with transcriptomic and/or proteomic steady state and/or timeline data to generate cell type selective models.<br>
