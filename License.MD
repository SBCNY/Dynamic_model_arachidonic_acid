The unpublished C# script that generated the MATLAB code and yED-network was written by Jens Hansen. Abhinav Jain and Jens Hansen curated reactions and reaction parameters, ran MATLAB simulations and discussed how to organize the MATLAB code written by the C# script. Philip Nevov supplied input about how to organize the MATLAB code for follow-up analyses. All were working for the Ravi Iyengar lab.<br>
