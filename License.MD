The unpublished C# script that wrote the MATLAB code and yED-network was written by Jens Hansen. Abhinav Jain and Jens Hansen curated reactions and reaction parameters, ran MATLAB simulations and discussed how to organize the MATLAB code written by the C# script. Both were working for the Ravi Iyengar lab.<br>
